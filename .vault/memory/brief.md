# Project Brief

## Mission
Comprehensive kanones ruleset for AI agentic IDE workflows, providing structured planning, task management, and quality assurance for software development projects. Enables seamless collaboration between AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini) and human developers through persistent context, strict quality gates, and standardized processes.

## Domain
- **Primary**: Software Development Tools, AI Agent Systems, IDE Integration
- **Secondary**: Project Management, Quality Assurance, Documentation Systems

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Markdown-based, IDE-agnostic, cross-platform, Git-compatible
- **Business**: Open-source, community-driven development, no external dependencies
- **Quality**: Rigorous validation, dependency gating, mandatory test strategies

## Stakeholders
- **Owner**: Open-source community, AI agent developers
- **Users**: Software developers using AI agents in Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf
- **Team**: Contributors to the kanones project, AI agent users

## Success Criteria
- [x] Seamless integration with major IDEs (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf)
- [x] Comprehensive adoption by AI agent users
- [x] Active community contribution and maintenance
- [x] Successful multi-agent collaboration workflows
- [ ] Production-ready documentation and examples

## Non-Negotiables
- Strict Plan/Act mode separation for safety
- Mandatory test strategy verification for quality
- Dependency validation before task execution
- Cross-agent compatibility and context persistence
- Regular vault synchronization and learning loops
