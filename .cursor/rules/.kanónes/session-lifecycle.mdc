## Operator Checklist

- Decide mode: Plan (author/update PRD/PRP and tasks) or Act (implement).
- Plan: write Thin PRP; generate tasks with IDs; update `TASKS.md`.
- Act: enforce dependency gate; implement per Implementation Details.
- Test: verify Test Strategy; run or confirm validation commands.
- Validate: ensure acceptance criteria; update flags and statuses.
- Sync & Learn: update progress, extract patterns, consider archive.
- Handoff: update active-context with state, next steps, gotchas.
